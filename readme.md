# Debounce Function

The `debounce` function is a utility function used to control the rate at which a function is called, particularly in scenarios where frequent or rapid invocations need to be throttled or limited. This can be useful in scenarios like handling user input or reducing the number of API requests.

## Usage

The `debounce` function takes two parameters: `func` and `delay`.

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timerId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timerId);

    timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(this)
      console.log(args)
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

- `func` is the function that needs to be debounced, meaning it will be executed after a certain delay period.
- `delay` specifies the time in milliseconds that we want to wait before invoking the debounced function.

To use the `debounce` function:

```javascript
const debouncedFetchData = debounce(fetchData, 300);
```

In this example, `fetchData` is the original function that we want to debounce, and `300` is the delay in milliseconds. Adjust the delay according to your needs.

Now, whenever `debouncedFetchData` is invoked, it will wait for 300 milliseconds of inactivity before executing the `fetchData` function. If `debouncedFetchData` is invoked again within the delay period, the timer will be reset, postponing the execution of `fetchData`.

Note: In the example provided, the `fetchData` function is used as an example. Replace it with your own function or logic that needs to be debounced.

Feel free to customize the `debounce` function to suit your specific requirements, such as handling the return value or passing additional arguments to the debounced function.

Remember to replace `fetchData` with your own function or logic that needs to be debounced.
